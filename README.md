![Walmart Listing Browser](docs/screenshot.png)

Keep an incentive price sheet on the left, and click any row to see its **live walmart.com listing** docked on the right — no tab-juggling between a spreadsheet and a browser.

## Features

- **Spreadsheet UI** — editable cells, formula bar, formulas (`=D2-C2`), Ctrl+F find, sortable columns, drag-to-reorder rows, custom columns.
- **Live listing pane** — the real walmart.com product page for the selected row, docked beside the sheet, with zoom and prev/next navigation.
- **Import** — pull rows in from `.xlsx` / `.csv` / `.tsv`, or paste straight from Google Sheets with Ctrl+V.
- **Export** — write the sheet back out to `.xlsx` (with live formulas) or `.csv`; handles the "file is open in Excel" case gracefully.
- **Auto-computed columns** — `$ Change` and `% Change` recompute from Before / During prices.
- **Local-first** — everything is stored in a local JSON file; no accounts, no server.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

### Build the Windows installer

```bash
npm run dist
```

The branded NSIS installer lands in `dist/Walmart Listing Browser Setup <version>.exe`.

## Import format

The first four columns of your sheet, in this order (a header row is fine — it's skipped):

| A | B | C | D |
|---|---|---|---|
| SKU | Item ID | Before Price | During Incentive |

Only SKU and Item ID are required; extra columns (`$ Change`, `% Change`, …) are ignored on import and recomputed in-app.

## Tech notes

- Electron 33, plain HTML/CSS/JS renderer (no framework).
- The listing pane is a `WebContentsView` — walmart.com refuses to render into a `<webview>`, so a window-grade view is docked over the layout instead.
- `exceljs` powers `.xlsx` import/export.
- Icon assets live in [`build/`](build/) — `icon.svg` is the master; `icon.png` / `icon.ico` are rasterized from it.
